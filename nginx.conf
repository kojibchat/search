# Most installations will have a default fastcgi_params file setup that you can just include as shown above. Some configurations donâ€™t include the SCRIPT_FILENAME parameter. You must ensure you include this parameter otherwise you might end up with a No input file specified error from the fastcgi process. This can be done directly in the location block or simply added to the fastcgi_params file. Either way it looks like this:
# fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;

server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  www.mysite.com mysite.com;
    root         /path/www.mysite.com/public_html;

    try_files $uri /index.php;

    # this will only pass index.php to the fastcgi process which is generally safer but
    # assumes the whole site is run via Slim.
    location /index.php {
        fastcgi_connect_timeout 3s;     # default of 60s is just too long
        fastcgi_read_timeout 10s;       # default of 60s is just too long
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;    # assumes you are running php-fpm locally on port 9000
    }
}
